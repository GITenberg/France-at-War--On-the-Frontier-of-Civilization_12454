description: During World War I, acclaimed author Rudyard Kipling visited the Western
  Front as a reporter and wrote about his experiences in France at War. These thoughtful
  pieces are ideal for history buffs and all the more compelling because Kipling's
  only son, John, was killed in the war at the Battle of Loos.
